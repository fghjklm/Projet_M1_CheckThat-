- GOAL AND GENERAL METHOD:
goal is to identify the viewpoint of a text (positive or negative) [abstract]
used technic: extract subjectives sentences and then classify the viewpoint [introduction]
detect subjectivity: minimum cut in a graph 
classify: SVM and xxxxx [2.1 architecture]

- SUBJ DETECTION METHOD:
minimize the formula sum( probability_to_be_in_class_1 ) + sum( probability_to_be_in_class_2 ) + sum( proba_xi_xk_in_same_class ) (xi appartenant à classe 1 et xk appartenant à classe 2) [2.3]
optimization trough graph reprezentation and minimum cut method [2.3]
s is the source (and each sentence in the same part of the cut is labelled subj) [2.3]
t is the sink (and each sentence in the same part of the cut is labelled obj) [2.3]
it helps to categorize sentences that will have a medium score individualy by taking association score in account. [2.3]
could be possible to add context (maybe by classifying paragrapahs instead of sentences) [4.2]
but add a huge constraint by classifying all the sentences in the paragraph in the same label [4.2]

- HELP OF SUBJ DETECTION FOR SENTIMENT ANALYSIS:
it increase score or can reduce the needed number of data [4]
subkjectivity detection can compress reviews int much shorter exracts that still retain polarity information [5. conclusion]
